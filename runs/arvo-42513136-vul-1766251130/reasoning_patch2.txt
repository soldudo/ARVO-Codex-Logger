"**Removing double frees and initializing pointers**

The code has double frees for `matching` from `list_matching_formats` and later frees
causing errors; the fix removes redundant `free(matching)` calls and initializes
`matching` to NULL before use to avoid misuse. Changes involve deleting frees at lines
95 and 116 in one file and line 239 in another, plus ensuring no double free happens
while avoiding leaks. The environment is read-only, so patches can't be applied directly
and must be provided as instructions with diffs."}}} "I couldn\u2019t write to the read-
only workspace, but here\u2019s the exact fix to remove the remaining double-frees.

Changes to apply:

- `binutils-preconditions/ada_objdump.h` - In `fuzz_display_object_bfd`, both ambiguous-
format branches already call `list_matching_formats(matching)`, which frees `matching`.
Remove the extra `free (matching);` calls immediately after `list_matching_formats` at
the first ambiguous branch (around lines 93\u201397) and the second one (around lines
113\u2013117). No other changes are needed there.

- `binutils-preconditions/ada_nm.h` - In `fuzz_display_file2`, the ambiguous-format
branch also calls `list_matching_formats(matching)` (which frees it). Remove the
subsequent `free (matching);` call at lines 239\u2013241.

After applying, the relevant snippets should look like:

- `ada_objdump.h` (first branch):
  ```c
  if (bfd_get_error () == bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized)
    {
      nonfatal (bfd_get_filename (abfd));
      list_matching_formats (matching);
      return 1;
    }
  ```
and similarly for the second branch near the end (drop the `free`).

- `ada_nm.h` ambiguous branch:
  ```c
  if (bfd_get_error () == bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized)
    {
      list_matching_formats (matching);
    }
  ```

These removals eliminate the double-free of the `matching` vector reported in the
updated ASan crash. Once you apply the edits, rebuild `fuzz_objdump_safe` and rerun the
reproducer to confirm the crash is gone."}}}

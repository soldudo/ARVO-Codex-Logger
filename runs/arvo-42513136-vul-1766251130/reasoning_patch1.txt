I tracked the ASan double-free to `fuzz_slurp_symtab` in `binutils-
preconditions/ada_objdump.h`: the temporary symbol table buffer `sy` was being freed
twice along the same call path (the canonicalize failure cleanup and the trailing `if
(syms) free(sy);` block), which matches the two close-by free call sites in the crash
stack. The fix is to free the buffer exactly once after `bfd_canonicalize_symtab` and
return early on failure.

Apply this edit in `ada_objdump.h` (around lines 61–70):

```c
  symcount = bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, sy);
  /* Free the caller-owned table once before returning to avoid double frees.  */
  if (sy)
    free (sy);

  if (symcount < 0)
    return 0;

  return 1;
```

(Replace the old two `free` blocks at lines 61–72.)

Note: the filesystem here is read-only, so I couldn’t save the change; please apply the
above patch in `binutils-preconditions/ada_objdump.h` to resolve the heap double-free.
Next step after updating: rebuild `fuzz_objdump_safe` and re-run the reproducer to
confirm the ASan crash is gone.

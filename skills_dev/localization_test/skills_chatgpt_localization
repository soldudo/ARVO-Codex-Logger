# Skills: Memory Safety Root-Cause Analysis (C)

This document enumerates techniques and tools you may use while investigating
memory-safety vulnerabilities in C projects.

Use these skills to support the strategy in agent.md.

## 1. Sanitizer Interpretation
You can:
- Read ASan/MSan/UBSan reports
- Identify the *actual faulting access*
- Distinguish symptom location vs cause location
- Recognize patterns:
  - MSan + realloc → stale pointer or partial init
  - ASan + encoding → buffer swap bug
  - OOB at read → pointer misalignment upstream

---

## 2. Pointer Invariant Reasoning
You understand and verify invariants such as:
- `cur >= base`
- `cur <= end`
- `end - base == initialized_length`
- `base/cur/end refer to the same allocation`
- pointers updated after realloc/memmove/shrink

You treat invariant violations as the *true bug*.

---

## 3. Buffer Lifecycle Tracing
You can trace buffers across:
- creation
- growth
- shrink
- replacement
- destruction

You pay special attention to:
- realloc-like semantics
- memmove-based shrink
- ownership transfer between buffers
- stale pointer windows

---

## 4. Error-Path Auditing
You explicitly audit:
- allocation failures
- partial conversions
- early returns
- cleanup logic

You check whether:
- state is rolled back on failure
- pointers are reset too early
- code continues execution after error

---

## 5. Encoding & Conversion Awareness
You recognize that:
- encoding switches often replace buffers
- conversion functions may:
  - consume partial input
  - move underlying memory
  - return success with side effects

You always verify pointer realignment after conversion.

---

## 6. Source Navigation Skills
You can efficiently:
- Search symbols with `rg`
- Inspect specific ranges with `sed` / `nl`
- Follow call chains across files
- Correlate sanitizer stacks to code paths

---


## 7. Documentation & Explanation
You can clearly explain:
- why the crash occurred
- which invariant was broken
- why this location is the root cause

Your explanations are suitable for:
- code reviewers
- security engineers
- academic artifacts
